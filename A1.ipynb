We first use nltk.ngrams to seperate the sentence, and when there is a preposition in the three word list, we use the Linear Interpolation n-gram model to calculate the possiblity of each prepostion. And the preposition with the highest possibility in the Linear Interpolation n-gram model will be the output of our prediction. And if the model think every prepostion word possibilty is 0, we will use the bigram model to predict the possibility. And if every prepoistion's possibility is still 0, we will use unigram model to predict it.\n",
